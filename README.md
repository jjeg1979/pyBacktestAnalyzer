# pyBacktestAnalyzer

## Algorithmic trading backtesting framework for Python.

Imagine yourself in the following situation: you are given thousands of different trading strategies and you have to choose the best one. How would you do it? You could try to extract the metrics of them all, but that would take a lot of time. You could also try to select only a few of them, but how would you know if you are not missing the best one? 

This is where pyBacktestAnalyzer comes in. It allows you to calculate the metrics of thousands of strategies in a matter of seconds and then choose the best one based on the results.
